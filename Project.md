# V21 Project Brief for Movie Directory App

## Purpose

This document is where all details related to scope, and development reside.

## Backlog

This section is where we'll document our User Stories, translate them into features and functionality, then break them down into tasks.

### Brian's User Stories

My User Stories will follow this pattern:

*As a < type of user >, I want < to achieve a specific goal > so that < a desired outcome is attained >.*

This pattern is based on Michael Cohn on his website [Mountain Goat Software](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories).
