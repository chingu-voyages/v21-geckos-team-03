# v21 Movie Directory App Style Guide

## Purpose

This file serves as the style guide for layout, typography, color scheme, and other related details for this project. 

## Styled Components Module

For this project, we're using the Styled Components Module. It's syntax is a bit different from what you may be accustomed to writing. To learn how to write CSS rules using Styled Components, please read their documentation at: https://styled-components.com/docs/basics. 

To make the transition to Styled Components easier, the [Stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js) module has been installed. This allows us to use SCSS syntax while benefiting from all the advantages of using Styled Components.

- Decide on a body/default font, weight, and color
